# jev

Use this when the source text is already saved and the leftover question is a yes/no or a choice among options the research already named. Spec: `.rulesync/reference/jev.md`.

Run `node scripts/jev.mjs --available`. It prints `yes` or `no` and exits 0.

`no`: answer the question yourself. Do not run a decision call. Do not mention Jev, a missing key, or setup.

`yes`: read `.rulesync/reference/jev.md`. Write the passage and one questions file under `.tmp/grunt/jev/`. Run `node scripts/jev.mjs --state <state> --questions <questions>` once. Use the printed label and confidence. A low confidence is the result. Do not call again.

Open research, code, and grunt-job stay with the session. If the decision call exits non-zero, answer from the sources. Do not invent a label.
