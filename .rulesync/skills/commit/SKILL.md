  Inspect the diff and commit with a Conventional Commits subject line. Use for
  /commit, "commit this", "commit these changes". Never pushes.
---

Inspect `git status` + `git diff` (staged and unstaged) before the message. Never push.

Stage only user intent. Never blind `git add -A` / `git add .`. Split unrelated concerns into multiple commits.

Message = Conventional Commits **subject only**: `type(scope): subject` (scope optional).

Types: feat fix docs style refactor perf test build ci chore revert.

Subject: imperative lowercase no trailing period.

NO body. NO footer. NO `Co-Authored-By`. NO `Generated with`. NO 🤖. NO trailers. No AI attribution. Work belongs to the human.

Never `git push`.

Protocol: `.rulesync/reference/cascade.md`. Do not paste cascade.
